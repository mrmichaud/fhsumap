Forsyth, the building that is now McCartney Hall housed the university's library collection for about forty years. The building's initially also housed offices, a few classrooms, a beautiful two-story reading room on the north side, and the Museum of Natural History on first floor. The building was remodeled into an academic building after the library moved across the street in 1967. McCartney Hall gained its current name in 1968 when the Kansas Board of Regents approved President M. C. Cunningham's recommendation to rename the building in honor of Dr. Ernest Ray &#34;E.R.&#34; McCartney, a long-time dean of the faculty and Professor of Economics and Business. The Sternberg Museum collections remained on the first floor until 1999 when the newly remodeled Beach Hall/Sternberg Museum opened in northeast Hays.

As dining needs continued to grow, Cody Commons was constructed in 1923 in the location of the present day Memorial Union kitchen/dining area. At a cost of $851,600, student fees alone financed the construction of the Memorial Union which was completed and dedicated during Homecoming on October 18, 1958. In 2007 the Union was renovated at a cost of $8.5M to include the beautiful new entrance on the west side. The building serves as a gathering space for faculty, staff, students and the general public, and stands as a memorial to those of FHSU who lost their lives in the defense of their country during the two world wars, the Korean conflict, and the Vietnam War. A bronze and walnut plaque in the Sunset Lounge in the Memorial Union lists the names of the FHSU men to whom the building was originally dedicated, and a memorial was added later next to the Memorial Union for those who died in Vietnam.",
